# Ditto

(coming soon)

This repository hosts a clone of the JSON data generated from [PokeAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi). I use this to test [PokeKotlin](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokekotlin) without spamming the live API.

All data is pulled automatically from [PokeAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi), which is based on [Veekun's data](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex).
